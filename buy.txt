Press unlock wallet & select your wallet
Enter the amount of BNB you would like to spend, or the amount of $TIDDIES you want to buy fire 
Press Swap and then Confirm Swap
Finally authorize the transaction
Within a few moments you should see a notification pop up in the top left corner indicating whether or not the swap was successful.
If you're getting errors, try increasing the slippage, a higher slippage is more important when the price is changing a lot due to lots of trading volume.
